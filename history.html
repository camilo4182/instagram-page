                            Instagram began development in San Francisco as Burbn, 
                            a mobile check-in app created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger.
                            Realizing that Burbn was too similar to Foursquare, Systrom and Krieger 
                            refocused their app on photo-sharing, which had become a popular feature among Burbn users.
                            They renamed the app Instagram, a portmanteau of instant camera and telegram.

                            On March 5, 2010, Systrom closed a $500,000 seed funding round with Baseline Ventures 
                            and Andreessen Horowitz while working on Burbn. Josh Riedel joined the company in October as 
                            Community Manager, Shayne Sweeney joined in November as an engineer, and Jessica Zollman 
                            joined as a Community Evangelist in August 2011.

                            The first Instagram post was a photo of South Beach Harbor at Pier 38, posted by Mike Krieger on July 16, 2010.

                        <p>
                            Systrom shared his first post, a picture of a dog and his girlfriend's foot, a few hours later (at 9:24 PM). 
                            It has been wrongly attributed as the first Instagram photo due to the earlier letter of the alphabet in its URL.

                            On October 6, 2010, the Instagram iOS app was officially released through the App Store.

                            2011: Major funding
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            In February 2011, it was reported that Instagram had raised $7 million in Series A funding 
                            from a variety of investors, including Benchmark Capital, Jack Dorsey, Chris Sacca 
                            (through Capital fund), and Adam D'Angelo. The deal valued Instagram at around $20 million.
                            In April 2012, Instagram raised $50 million from venture capitalists with a $500 million valuation.
                            Joshua Kushner was the second largest investor in Instagram's Series B fundraising round, leading 
                            his investment firm, Thrive Capital, to double its money after the sale to Facebook.

                            2012: Android release, Facebook acquisition and web launch
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            On April 3, 2012, Instagram released a version of its app for Android phones, and it was 
                            downloaded more than one million times in less than one day.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On April 9, 2012, Facebook, Inc. bought Instagram for $1 billion in cash and stock, with a plan to 
                            keep the company independently managed. Britain's Office of Fair Trading approved the deal on 
                            August 14, 2012, and on August 22, 2012, the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. closed its investigation, 
                            allowing the deal to proceed. On September 6, 2012, the deal between Instagram and Facebook officially closed 
                            with a purchase price of $300 million in cash and 23 million shares of stock.

                            The deal closed just before Facebook's scheduled initial public offering according to CNN. The deal price was 
                            compared to the $35 million Yahoo! paid for Flickr in 2005. Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook was "committed to 
                            building and growing Instagram independently." According to Wired, the deal netted Systrom $400 million.

                            In November 2012, Instagram launched website profiles, allowing anyone to see user feeds from a web browser 
                            with limited functionality.
